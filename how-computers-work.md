# How Computers Work


First and Foremost:


all computers do __*four*__ basic things-

-Take __*Input*__

-__*Store*__ Data

-__*Process*__ The Data

-__*Output*__ Results

## Binary and Data

Binary is composed of 1's and 0's, it can count to any number by using a combination of these. A nine in binary is 1001. Text images and sound can also be represented with binary.

## Circuits and Logic

Circuits transfer bit data. Circuits can also modify bits, add them, and transform them. Combining many of these circuits can result in much more complex calculations

## Cpu, Memory, Input and Output

CPU is the Central Processing Unit, it processes the information, if you couldn't guess. CPU talks to the Memory unit to find out how to process the bits its receiving.
Types of output include, sound, printing, robots etc...

## Hardware and Software

Hardware is the physical parts of a computer. Circuits, CPU, RAM, HD, SSD, GPU, powerbrick, etc...

Software is everything you dont see, all the computer programs, windows 10, websites, games, safari, git, discord, etc.
