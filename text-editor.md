# What Is A Text Editor?

# Choosing A Text Editor
#### There are many different types of text editors out there, and choosing the right one is of your best interest. The only correct way to choose the right text editor, is just that, you choose it. It doesnt matter which one you end up with, as long as you enjoy using it. Some are technically better than others, or may have more features, but it's all preference in the end.

# What To Look For In A Text Editor
#### 1.) code completion, basically short cuts when writing code, auto completion options, Emmet, etc.
#### 2.) syntax highlighting
#### 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue) 
#### 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them
### keep in mind, all computers have a text editor installed on them. however, they are very bare bones and lack alot of quality of life features.
