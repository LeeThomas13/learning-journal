### Grouping together related content into blocks and chunks makes the page look simpler and easier to understand.

### Visual Hierarchy is utilized in many websites, often expressed by usage of images. Other things hat establish visual hierarchy are __SIZE__ __COLOR__ and __STYLE__. The larger elements grab our attention first, color can draw attention to key messages, and style helps funnel the important information and keep it tight and concise. 

### Grouping and Similarity - proximity makes items seem more related. Utilizing white space can help create separate categories of items. Using boarders will help group items.

## __HTML NOTES__

### Attributes provide additional information about contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

### Utilizing ID and Class Attributes

#### Every element/tag can carry a unique ID or a Class. Every tag has its own unique ID that you can use to modify it. You can also assign any number of tags to a Class, making it easy to select and modify selected tags.

### Block Elements 

#### Examples are <h1> <p> <ul> <li>

### Inline Elements

#### Examples are <a> <b> <em> <img>

### Grouping text and element in a block

The div element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box
Utilizing an ID or Class attribute on the div element can creates a CSS style rule to indicate certain changes, such as how much space the div element should occupy on the screen and change the appearance of all the elements contained with it.

### Grouping text & elements inline

Using the span element acts like an inline equivalent of the div element. It is used to either contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
