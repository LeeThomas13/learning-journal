## Who Am I?
First and foremost I am a student software developer at Code Fellows! I love gaming, building computers, photography, scuba diving, music production, snowboarding, puzzles and most of all, learning. I was born in Virginia, raised in Ohio, spent most of my teenage-adult life in California, and now I am in Seattle working on my future.
