## Notes From The Book

### what is CSS exactly?
         
         -CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. Utilizes HTML to find and work on these elements.
         
         -Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like)
         
         -Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of an element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.

## Linking CSS to HTML

in the head of the HTML, you will see a <link> that you plug the url/file of the CSS code

## Inline Styling

you can do inline styling by adding elements in the line of code on your HTML. <h1 style="color: blue">

## Internal Styling

you can also write CSS formatted code into your html file.
